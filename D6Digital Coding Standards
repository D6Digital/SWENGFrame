Software & Testing Coding Standard Practise


• Class naming should be completely capitalised, e.g. public class MyNewClass {


• Method naming should begin lowercase but continue capitalised, e.g. myReallyCoolMethod()



• Variable naming should begin lowercase but continue capitalised, e.g. int newInteger = 0;





Variable Declarations


• Type Boolean should always be used over boolean


• Indentations should be set to 4 spaces (Window->Preferences->Java->Code Style->Formatter-
>Edit->Indentation = "Spaces Only")






Documentation


• Any incomplete methods/classes etc. should be labelled with //TODO: followed by suitable 

comment explaining what work needs completing.


• All methods should be documented using the /** JavaDoc notation and should contain @param 

followed by a suitable description for the input parameter, @return for the return statement, as 

well as a suitable description of the operation of the method.


• All classes should be documented using the /** JavaDoc notation and should contain @author

with author name, as well as a suitable description of the class contents and purpose.




Testing


• All JUnit test classes should have additional class documentation in the form of a Test ID 

following immediately from the author name. The ID will relate to a given test case which has 

been issued by the testing manager.


• The use of assertTrue(x) should be avoided and should instead be replaced with: 

assertEquals(“this test failed because y did not happen, caused by x being false...”, x, true); 

This will enable the person running the test to found out what has failed by the description given 

in the message parameter.
